In this project we train a fully conventional network to find and track ("Follow") a target. In this case, we have identified our target as a person dressed in red. The person is on a specific path and the quadcopter will patrol on its on path until the target is identified and locked in. The idenfitication of the target and the ability to follow the target is based of of the model that we capture from our network training.

Here I show the picture of when I was training the network from a far distance. You can see green quadcopter patrol points, pink target movement path and blue spawn initial paths.
